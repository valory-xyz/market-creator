# Market creator

Market creator (market maker) is an autonomous service created with the [Open Autonomy framework](https://docs.autonolas.network/open-autonomy/) that processes worldwide news using an LLM and opens prediction markets on the Gnosis chain. The service roughly works as follows:

1. Gather headlines and summaries of recent news through a third-party provider.
2. Interact with an LLM (using the gathered information in the previous step) to obtain a collection of suitable questions to open prediction markets associated to future events.
3. Propose questions to a market approval service endpoint. Users manually approve suitable markets using that endpoint.
4. Collect user-approved markets from the market approval service.
5. Send the necessary transactions to the Gnosis chain to open and fund the chosen prediction market.
6. Repeat steps 1-5. When `NUM_MARKETS` (configurable) have been created, the service will cycle in a waiting state.

## Market maker runtime parameters

Market maker has several configurable parameters for creating markets. These parameters can be configured at agent level (i.e., when running the code as a single agent) in the file [`packages/valory/agents/market_maker/aea-config.yaml`](https://github.com/valory-xyz/market-creator/blob/main/packages/valory/agents/market_maker/aea-config.yaml) ); and at service level (i.e., when running the code as a service composed of agent(s)) in the file [`packages/valory/services/market_maker/service.yaml`](https://github.com/valory-xyz/market-creator/blob/main/packages/valory/services/market_maker/service.yaml)).

- `num_markets`: Number of markets an agent to allowed to create before, default is 1
- `market_fee`: Fees for creating a market, default is 2 unit (Eth, xDAI, etc...)
- `initial_funds`: Initial funds for the market, default is 1 unit (Eth, xDAI, WxDAI, etc...)
- `market_timeout`: Maximum time allowed for finalizing answer on `realitio`, default is 1 day
- `minimum_market_time`: Minimum time for which the market should be active after opening, default is 7 days
- `realitio_contract`: Address of the realitio oracle contract, [default](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x79e32aE03fb27B07C89c0c568F80287C01ca2E57/)
- `realitio_oracle_proxy_contract`: Address of the realitio oracle proxy contract, [default](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x2bf1BFb0eB6276a4F4B60044068Cb8CdEB89f79B/)
- `conditional_tokens_contract`: Address of the conditional tokens that are going to be used, [default](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xCeAfDD6bc0bEF976fdCd1112955828E00543c0Ce/)
- `fpmm_deterministic_factory_contract`: Address of the fixed product marker maker contract, [default](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x9083A2B699c0a4AD06F63580BDE2635d26a3eeF0)
- `collateral_tokens_contract`: Address of the collateral token to be used for market, default is [WxDAI](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xe91d153e0b41518a2ce8dd3d7944fa863463a97d)
- `arbitrator_contract`: Address of the arbitration provider contract, default is [kleros](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xe40DD83a262da3f56976038F1554Fe541Fa75ecd)

The market maker agent is configured to work with the Gnosis chain by default, if you want to use the agent with other chains you can figure out what contracts to use from [here](https://github.com/protofire/omen-exchange/blob/a98fff28a71fa53b43e7ae069924564dd597d9ba/README.md)

## Testing a single agent locally

Run a Tendermint node using

```bash
bash run_tm.sh
```

and in a separate terminal, run

```bash
bash run_agent.sh
```

Now running an agent this way, will not create any market since the agent depends on gnosis multisig contract to execute the final transactions which actually creates the agent. So if you want to run an agent end 2 end you will require a gnosis multisig safe with 1 registered member. To do this run following in your terminal

```bash
aea generate-key ethereum
```

This will generate a ethereum private in your working directory in a file named `ethereum_private_key.txt`. You can add some funds to this key and create a gnosis multisig using their [app](https://app.safe.global/welcome). Once you create a multisig, update the [safe_contract_address](https://github.com/valory-xyz/market-creator/blob/0bab9ff6b41c2f024cc1f0d2aa149347fd0f47a9/packages/valory/agents/market_maker/aea-config.yaml#L149) parameter on the `aea-config.yaml` and use the `ethereum_private_key.txt` to run the agent using the script mentioned above. 

Also make sure your multisig safe account holds some amount of the tokens which you're planning on using as collateral. By default the agent uses `WxDAI` as collateral.

## Testing the service against Gnosis Mainnet

- Prepare the agent keys:

    ```bash
    cat > keys.json << EOF
    [
    {
        "address": "<your_agent_address>",
        "private_key": "<your_agent_private_key>"
    }
    ]
    EOF
    ```


- Prepare an .env file with the following environment variables.
    Note that if you do not specify an environment variable, it will take its default value from the service configuration file [`packages/valory/services/market_maker/service.yaml`](https://github.com/valory-xyz/market-creator/blob/main/packages/valory/services/market_maker/service.yaml).

    ```bash

    # The directory specified in KEY_DIR must contain a keys.json file
    # with the addresses and private keys of the agents.
    KEY_DIR=<path_to_the_folder_containing_your_keys>

    # Topics to create questions 
    TOPICS='["business","science","technology","politics","arts","weather"]'
    ```

- Edit the file `market_identification_prompt.txt`. You must include the placeholders `{input_news}` and `{topics}` in the prompt.

- Build and run the service:

    ```bash
    bash run_service.sh
    ```
