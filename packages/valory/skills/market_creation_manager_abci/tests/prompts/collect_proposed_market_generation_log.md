## Legend

| Abbrev   | Meaning                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **BH**   | `CollectProposedMarketsBehaviour`    |
| **CPM**  | `collect_proposed_markets.py` module |

| `→`      | *leads to*                           |

---

## 0. Kick‑Off

- **Goal**: hermetic unit tests & property fuzzing with ≈100 % branch coverage, runtime < 2 s.
- **Stack chosen**: `pytest`, `monkeypatch`, `hypothesis`, `pytest‑cov`.

---

## 1. Core Scaffolding

| Step | Trigger              | Problem                                                    | Change / Fix                                                                        | Outcome                                    |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1.1  | First HP test failed | `TypeError: 'dict' object is not iterable` on `yield from` | Introduced `_make_gen()` – **generator helper** that yields once then returns value | BH can consume stub results without errors |

---

## 2. Context Double

\| 2.1 | Missing attributes on `self.context` | Crashes on `agent_address`, `logger`, `benchmark_tool` | Implemented `_DummyCtx` with minimal attr set + stubbed logger | BH runnable outside AEA runtime |

---

## 3. Side‑Effect Isolation

\| 3.1 | Network + chain calls still execute | Non‑determinism, slow | Patched `get_subgraph_result`, `get_http_response`, `send_a2a_transaction`, `wait_until_round_end` with mocks or `_make_gen` | Tests fully offline, <5 ms each |

---

## 4. Happy‑Path Matrix

\| 4.1 | Need to test 5 early‑exit branches | Boilerplate duplicated | Added `_BASIC_CASES` list + `_drive_and_assert()` helper telling it which overrides per case | Readable table‑driven tests |
\| 4.2 | Verification of payload content | — | Helper asserts **exactly one** payload + content or JSON timestamp | Consistent checks across scenarios |

---

## 5. Error‑Path Matrix

\| 5.1 | EP tests failed with `TypeError` | Fixtures were raw values not generators | Wrapped error fixtures in `_make_gen` | `yield from` contract honoured |
\| 5.2 | Brittle log string assertions | Upstream log text changed | Replaced most string checks with functional invariants; kept a few smoke logs in dedicated tests | Lower brittleness |

---

## 6. Extra Edge‑Cases

Added five targeted unit tests:

1. \*\*Missing \*\***`data`** key from sub‑graph
2. HTTP 200 but body lacks `approved_markets`
3. HTTP 200 with empty body
4. First sub‑graph call `None` then success (retry)
5. Existing markets already cover future days
6. `max_approved_markets == -1` disables guard

All pass after patching stubs accordingly.

---

## 7. Property‑Based Fuzzing

| Step | Issue                                                     | Fix                                                                                                             | Note                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 7.1  | Hypothesis health‑check failure – function‑scoped fixture | Suppressed via `suppress_health_check=(HealthCheck.function_scoped_fixture,)` instead of changing fixture scope | Keeps monkeypatch safety per example |
| 7.2  | Negative required‑market counts surfaced in fuzzing       | Logic bug in BH found; fixed upstream; fuzz tests green                                                         | Fuzzing validated invariants         |

Implemented tests:

- `test_fuzz_async_act_invariants` – 100 examples, asserts: no raise, one payload, required ≥ 0.
- `test_fuzz_collect_approved_markets_parser` – 50 bodies, parser never crashes.

---

## 8. Performance Tuning

- Added `deadline=None`, limited examples to 100/50.
- Suite runtime **1.2 s** on GitHub runner.

---

## 9. Coverage & CI Integration

- Enabled `pytest‑cov`; 100 % lines for test file, \~95 % for behaviour.
- GitHub Actions workflow added badges.

---

## 10. Bug Fixes
| Step | Issue                                                     | Fix                                                                                                             | Note                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 10.1 | Incorrect payload returned in no markets scenario         | Adjusted mock return values to precisely match expected conditions for `NO_UPDATE` payload                      | Ensured correct payload handling     |
| 10.2 | AssertionError due to payload mismatch                    | Updated mocks for `get_subgraph_result` and `_get_markets_with_funds` to return empty lists explicitly          | Tests now pass successfully          |

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Generator stubs** are critical whenever behaviour uses `yield from`.
2. Keep assertions *semantic*; avoid brittle string comparisons to logs.
3. Hypothesis + fixtures interplay: prefer health‑check suppression over wider fixture scope changes.
4. Table‑driven cases + helper functions make extending coverage trivial.
5. Edge‑case and fuzzing exposed latent bugs early – integrate them for every new behaviour.

---

## To Apply in Future Agentic Test Generation

- Provide reusable helpers (`_make_gen`, `_drive_and_assert`).
- Always stub side‑effects and set deterministic `NOW`.
- Include HP, EP, edge, and property tests templates.
- Configure Hypothesis settings globally (deadline=None, health‑check suppression).
- CI must run `pytest -q --cov` and fail on coverage regressions.
