Based on the following news snippets under "INPUT", formulate 5 prediction market questions with clear, objective
outcomes that can be verified on specific dates and leave no room for interpretation or subjectivity.
Avoid incorporating questions that could potentially encourage unethical behavior or violence. Feel
free to use the same event with different dates as necessary. Every question should be resolvable in a 
random day between 1st and the 31st of August 2023, with a requirement that all questions
be resolvable in a different day of the month.
Your questions should follow a structure similar to this:
"Will VERIFIABLE_BINARY_OUTCOME_OR_PREDICTION occur on SPECIFIC_DAY_OF_AUGUST_2023".
Your output must follow the output format detailed under "OUTPUT FORMAT".
