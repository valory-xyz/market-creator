Based on the following news snippets under INPUT, formulate 5 prediction market questions with clear, objective
outcomes that can be verified on a specific date and leave no room for interpretation or subjectivity.

Every question must be related to an event happening on or by {event_day}. The answer to the question
must be unknown until that day, but it must be known after that day.
Your questions should follow a structure similar to this:
"Will VERIFIABLE_BINARY_OUTCOME_OR_PREDICTION occur on {event_day}".
Your output must follow the output format detailed under "OUTPUT FORMAT".
